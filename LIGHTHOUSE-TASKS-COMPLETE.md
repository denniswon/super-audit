# ✅ Lighthouse Hardhat Tasks - Complete Implementation

## Overview

Five new Hardhat tasks have been successfully implemented for managing playbooks with Lighthouse/IPFS community storage. All tasks work with the **zero-setup shared API key** - no user configuration required!

## 🎯 Implemented Tasks

### 1. `lighthouse-info` - Storage Information

Shows Lighthouse configuration, usage instructions, and available commands.

**Usage:**

```bash
npx hardhat lighthouse-info
```

**Features:**

- Displays storage status (shared vs custom API key)
- Shows all available commands
- Provides helpful tips and examples
- No parameters required

---

### 2. `upload-playbook` - Upload to Community Storage

Upload a playbook YAML file to shared Lighthouse/IPFS storage and register it.

**Usage:**

```bash
PLAYBOOK_FILE=./playbooks/your-playbook.yaml npx hardhat upload-playbook
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd packages/example-project
PLAYBOOK_FILE=./playbooks/erc20-token-security.yaml npx hardhat upload-playbook
```

**Output:**

```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Structure

All tasks are implemented as separate files:

```
packages/plugin/src/tasks/
├── analyze.ts                 # Main analysis task (existing)
├── upload-playbook.ts         # Upload to Lighthouse
├── download-playbook.ts       # Download from Lighthouse
├── list-playbooks.ts          # List all playbooks
├── sync-playbooks.ts          # Sync community playbooks
└── lighthouse-info.ts         # Show info and help
```

### Task Registration

Tasks are registered in `packages/plugin/src/index.ts`:

```typescript
task("lighthouse-info", "Show Lighthouse storage configuration and usage information.")
  .setAction(() => import("./tasks/lighthouse-info.js"))
  .build(),

task("upload-playbook", "Upload a security playbook to Lighthouse/IPFS community storage.")
  .setAction(() => import("./tasks/upload-playbook.js"))
  .build(),

task("download-playbook", "Download and register a playbook from Lighthouse by CID.")
  .setAction(() => import("./tasks/download-playbook.js"))
  .build(),

task("list-playbooks", "List all registered security playbooks.")
  .setAction(() => import("./tasks/list-playbooks.js"))
  .build(),

task("sync-playbooks", "Sync playbooks from Lighthouse community storage.")
  .setAction(() => import("./tasks/sync-playbooks.js"))
  .build(),
```

### Parameter Handling

Due to Hardhat v3's strict argument validation, tasks use **environment variables** for parameters:

- `PLAYBOOK_FILE` - File path for upload-playbook
- `PLAYBOOK_CID` - CID for download-playbook

This approach:

- ✅ Avoids Hardhat's argument validation errors
- ✅ Works consistently across platforms
- ✅ Clear and explicit
- ✅ Easy to use in scripts

### Zero-Setup Architecture

All tasks automatically use the shared Lighthouse API key:

```typescript
// No user setup required!
const lighthouse = initializeLighthouseFromEnv();
// Falls back to: ecbf40ec.0e9cd023d26c4a038e0fafa1690f32a3
```

## 📋 Complete Workflow Example

### 1. Check Lighthouse Status

```bash
npx hardhat lighthouse-info
```

### 2. Upload a Custom Playbook

```bash
PLAYBOOK_FILE=./my-playbook.yaml npx hardhat upload-playbook
# Copy the CID from output
```

### 3. Share the CID

Share the CID with your team:

```
bafkreifnhbl7m6jga6f24b7wiqo6iyrk46nuubdcpwx4bjhsvsps3otygy
```

### 4. Download on Another Machine

```bash
PLAYBOOK_CID=bafkreif... npx hardhat download-playbook
```

### 5. Run Analysis with Shared Playbook

```bash
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook-cid bafkreif...
```

### 6. List All Available Playbooks

```bash
npx hardhat list-playbooks
```

### 7. Sync Community Playbooks

```bash
npx hardhat sync-playbooks
```
