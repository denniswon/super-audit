## 🔗 Integration with Analysis

Use uploaded/downloaded playbooks directly:

```bash
# By CID (recommended for sharing)
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook-cid bafkreih...

# By ID (for locally registered playbooks)
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook-id my-playbook

# By file path (traditional)
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook ./playbooks/my-playbook.yaml
```

## 🌐 Sharing Playbooks

1. Upload your playbook:

```bash
PLAYBOOK_FILE=./my-custom-playbook.yaml npx hardhat upload-playbook
```

2. Copy the CID from output (example):

```
bafkreifnhbl7m6jga6f24b7wiqo6iyrk46nuubdcpwx4bjhsvsps3otygy
```

3. Share the CID with your team

4. They can use it directly:

```bash
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook-cid bafkreifnhbl7m6jga6f24b7wiqo6iyrk46nuubdcpwx4bjhsvsps3otygy
```

No setup needed on their end!

## ⚡ Tips

- **No API Key Required** - The plugin uses shared community storage
- **Uploads are Public** - Anyone with the CID can access your playbook
- **CIDs are Permanent** - Content-addressed storage means your playbooks never disappear
- **Sync Regularly** - Run `sync-playbooks` to get the latest community playbooks
- **Custom Storage** - Want private storage? Add `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY` to your `.env`

## 🎯 Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Team Collaboration

```bash
# Team Lead uploads playbook
PLAYBOOK_FILE=./team-playbook.yaml npx hardhat upload-playbook
# Shares CID: bafkreih...

# Team members use it
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook-cid bafkreih...
```

### Workflow 2: Community Contribution

```bash
# Create and upload your playbook
PLAYBOOK_FILE=./my-awesome-playbook.yaml npx hardhat upload-playbook

# Share CID on GitHub/Discord/Twitter
# Others benefit from your work!
```

### Workflow 3: Multi-Project Setup

```bash
# List all available playbooks
npx hardhat list-playbooks

# Pick one for your project
npx hardhat superaudit --playbook-id erc20-security

# Or download a specific one
PLAYBOOK_CID=bafkreih... npx hardhat download-playbook
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Playbook file not found"

- Check the file path is correct
- Use relative paths from your current directory
- Example: `./playbooks/my-file.yaml` not just `my-file.yaml`

### "CID is required"

- Make sure you set the PLAYBOOK_CID environment variable
- Example: `PLAYBOOK_CID=bafkreih... npx hardhat download-playbook`

### "Upload failed"

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the YAML file is valid
- Try again (network issues are temporary)

### "No new playbooks to sync"

- This is normal! Means you're up to date
- Run again later to check for new community playbooks
