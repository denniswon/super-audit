# Lighthouse Community Storage - User Guide

## Overview

MrklTree includes **automatic decentralized storage** for security playbooks using Lighthouse (IPFS). **No API key required!**

## Key Features

### 🌐 Shared Community Storage

- **Zero Setup**: Works out of the box, no registration needed
- **Decentralized**: Playbooks stored on IPFS, accessible to everyone
- **Community Driven**: Share playbooks with the entire MrklTree community

### 🔒 Optional Private Storage

- Users can provide their own Lighthouse API key for private storage
- Set `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file

## How It Works

### Default Behavior (Recommended)

The plugin automatically uses a shared community Lighthouse account:

```bash
# Just run auditagent - Lighthouse works automatically!
npx hardhat auditagent
```

You'll see:

```
🌐 Using shared MrklTree community Lighthouse storage
```

### Using Your Own API Key (Optional)

If you want private storage, add to `.env`:

```env
LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

You'll see:

```
🔑 Using custom Lighthouse API key from environment
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Upload a Playbook to Community Storage

**Coming Soon**: Upload command will be available via Hardhat task parameters.

For now, playbooks are automatically synced when you run analysis.

### 2. Load Playbook from CID

Once playbooks are uploaded, anyone can use them:

```bash
# Load a specific playbook by its IPFS CID
npx hardhat auditagent --playbook-cid bafkreih...
```

### 3. List Available Community Playbooks

```bash
# See all playbooks in your registry (including community playbooks)
npx hardhat auditagent --list-playbooks
```

## Automatic Sync

Every time you run MrklTree, it automatically:

1. Connects to shared Lighthouse storage
2. Syncs community playbooks to your local registry
3. Makes them available for your security analysis

```
✅ Loaded 5 shared playbook(s) from community
```

## Benefits

### For Users

- ✅ **No Setup Required**: Works immediately after installation
- ✅ **No Costs**: Free IPFS storage via shared account
- ✅ **No Registration**: No need to sign up for Lighthouse
- ✅ **Community Access**: Benefit from playbooks created by others

### For Contributors

- 📤 **Easy Sharing**: Upload playbooks to help the community
- 🌍 **Global Distribution**: IPFS ensures worldwide availability
- 🔗 **Permanent Links**: CID-based addressing means playbooks never break
- 📊 **Transparent**: All community playbooks are publicly visible

## Security Considerations

### Shared Storage

- **Public by Default**: Playbooks uploaded to community storage are public
- **Read-Only Access**: Community members can download, not modify
- **Immutable**: Once uploaded, playbooks cannot be changed (CID-based)

### Private Storage

If you need private playbooks:

1. Get your own Lighthouse API key from [https://lighthouse.storage](https://lighthouse.storage)
2. Add `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY` to `.env`
3. Upload playbooks using your private account

## Technical Details

### Default API Key

- Managed by MrklTree maintainers
- Shared across all plugin users
- Funded for community use
- Rate limits apply to fair usage

### IPFS Gateway

- Default: `https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/`
- All playbooks accessible via standard IPFS gateways
- Content-addressable storage ensures integrity

## FAQ

A: No! The plugin includes a shared community account at no cost.

**Q: Can I use my own Lighthouse account?**
A: Yes! Just set `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY` in your `.env` file.

**Q: Are my uploaded playbooks private?**
