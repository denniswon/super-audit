checks:

    ai_prompt: |
      Analyze this code for reentrancy vulnerabilities in the context of DeFi protocols.
      Consider:
      1. The specific attack vector for this pattern
      2. How much ETH or tokens could be stolen
      3. Detailed step-by-step fix with code examples
      4. Alternative secure patterns (e.g., ReentrancyGuard)

      Provide a clear explanation that developers can understand.

  - id: "access-control-check"
    rule: "pattern.missing(modifier=['onlyOwner'])"
    severity: "high"
    description: "Verify critical functions have proper access control"
    ai_prompt: |
      Analyze this access control vulnerability.
      Explain:
      1. What actions an attacker could perform
      2. Potential financial impact
      3. How to implement proper access control
      4. Best practices for role-based permissions

  - id: "unchecked-return"
    rule: "pattern.exists(call=['call', 'delegatecall', 'send'], checked=false)"
    severity: "high"
    description: "Ensure external call return values are checked"
    ai_prompt: |
      Analyze this unchecked return value vulnerability.
      Consider:
      1. What happens if the call silently fails?
      2. How could this lead to fund loss?
      3. Best practices for handling call failures
      4. Code example showing proper error handling

  - id: "integer-overflow"
    rule: "pattern.arithmetic(operations=['*', '+', '-', '/'], unchecked=true)"
    severity: "medium"
    description: "Check for unchecked arithmetic that could overflow"
    ai_prompt: |
      Analyze this arithmetic operation for overflow/underflow risks.
      Explain:
      1. Scenarios where overflow could occur
      2. Financial impact of overflow exploitation
      3. Why SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ checked math is important
      4. Concrete fix with code examples
